TAOITUS’S CHARAOTER OF THE
EMPEROR TIBERIUS.

NIEBurml in his lectures on the History of Rome quotes a
remark said to have been made by Napoleon L, that Tacitus
had not done justice to Tiberius There is at present a growing
disposition to incline to this view. Dean Merivale in his
“History of the Romans under the Empire '' points out that
he had great merits, and that he has been in all probability
much misrepresented by ancient writers. Professor Beesly
goes further, and has argued at considerable length in two

foulest sensuality. Certainly, in the pages of Tacitus, he
stands before us as a man who dissembled with consummate
skill and with infinite delight. Something like a hardened
cynicism, which carecl not for contemporary opinion or for
that of posterity, seems to have been the basis of his character,
if we judge him solely from Tacitus. Niebuhr, though he
allows he had. some virtues as well as great abilities, and
quotes with approval the remark above referred to, has not
ventured to dispute the generally accepted view, and believes
him to have been both a tyrant and debauchee. There was
always, he thinks, a hateful side to his character, and this
during his reign was more and more developed. Is this a true
estimate of him? Dean Merivale is sceptica13 Professor Beesly
denies itin toto, andis confident that the emperor has been
shamefully maligned.

Our knowledge about Tiberius is drawn mainly from
four writers, Tacitus, Suetonius, Dion Cassius, and Velleius
Paterculus. Among the first three there is a general agree-
