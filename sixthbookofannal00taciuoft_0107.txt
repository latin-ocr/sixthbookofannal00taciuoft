THE EMPEROR TIBERIUS. 87

Velleius as simply an honest and straightforward soldier, to
whom flattery would be distasteful. It is quite possible that
he may have described without exaggeration Tiberius’s achieve-
ments in Germany, and the affection and confidence with
which he inspired the troops. That Tiberius was a general of
the highest ability, that he showed a strong sense of duty in
his care for his men, and was regarded by them with positive
enthusiasm, is, we think, likely to be true. At any rate, we
do not see why we should not take Velleius's word for all this.
But are we not on unsafe ground when we argue from it that
there could not have been latent in Tiberius a bad and hateful
side of his character, which subsequent circumstances de-
veloped and ultimately brought into frightful prominence?
Is it not quite possible that a man may have had all the great
and good qualities, which Velleius attributes to Tiberius, up to
a mature age, and yet in his declining years have become,
under special temptations‚ a tyrant and a sensualist? Nor,
again, have we any certainty that Tiberius, though a good
soldier, an accomplished and cultivated man with some real
virtues, may not have had a secret inclination to vice, and
indulged it when opportunity offered. It seems to us that we
have not the evidence which can justify us in pronouncing con-
fidently on such a matter. If Tacitus is to be assumed to
have had a strong bias which made him take the worst view of
Tiberius, it must also be remembered that Velleius had
powerful motives to speak well of him. It is going too far,
we think, to impute to Tacitus deliberate and continuous
misrepresentation solely on the strength of the excessive
eulogies of Velleius. It is, however, perfectly fair to scrutinize
closely Tacitus's own narrative and see whether there are
grounds for suspecting that he has dealt particularly hard
measure to Tiberius. It may be so, without our having to
suppose that he was an utterly unscrupulous historian. Had
he been this, he would not have hesitated in plain terms to
have pronounced Nero the author of the great fire at Rome in
ΑΛ). 64, as, it seems, most writers did. But he had, unques-
tionably, a very bitter dislike of the Caesars and of Caesarism.
He hated the Caesars as the destroyers of the old Roman free-
dom, and, though he may have recognised the necessity of a
political revolution and even of the concentration of power in
the hands of one man, he heartily disliked the authors of the
change. It was under Tiberius that this change may be said
to have been fully consummated, and this fact would be enough
to present him in an odious light to the Roman nobility, and
to the class to which Tacitus belonged. He would be held up
to infamy as the subvertet of free institutions. If it could
also be said with any truth that he was a proud, ungenial‚
and reserved man, it would be almost a moral certainty that
he would be the subject of gross misrepresentation, and that
