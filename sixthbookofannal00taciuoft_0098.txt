CHAPTER L.

1. Jam,..deserebat‚] ‘Ah-eady the emperor's constitu-
tion and strength were leaving him, not yet his habit of dis-
semblingss It is hard to find a good rendering of ‘dissimulatiov
for which the Greek equivalent would be εἰρωνεία. Tiberius, as
painted by Tacitus, was a consummate εἴρων. He dissembled
to the very last.

2. Idem animi rigon] Tliat is, he maintained the same
unyieldingness of spirit. He would not, so to say, be beaten.
The context explains this more in detail.

3· Sermone ac vultu intentus] In ‘intentus' there is
the notion of tension‚ as in a strung bow. The emperor kept

himself in a state of tension. He piade a sustained effort to
talk and to look as if he were well and strong.

(Marius, 34) this had been a country house of 1111111113, and was
inore luxuriously furnished than might seeni suitable for a
hardy soldier. It was subsequently aequired by Cornelia, the
wife of Pompey the (irent, und {rom her it passed by purehase
into the possession oi Lucius Lucullus,

7. Supremis] ‘Suprema’ is constantly used by the later
Roman writers sor a person’s last moments, or for his mneral

obsequies.

8- Non quidem regere valetudines] Tiberius, as we
are told in ch. 46, thought that after thirty years of age a man

could regulate his health without medical advice.
