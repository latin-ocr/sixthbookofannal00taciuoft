NOTES. 73

3. Retinens] By an unusual construction=memor.

4. Sua populo vis] Sc. the people as well as the Senate
had a voice in the government.

5. Quotiens concordes agunt] ‘Whenever senate and
people act together!

6· Aeolidis] Sc. Parthus.

7. Id...regnante‚] That is, Artabanus had been called
in to help one side, and he had made the senate, or upper class,
supreme.

11. Cetera degenerem] On his father’s side Artabanus

on the opposite bank of the Tigris.

15. Prolatabant] Sc. Phraates and Hiero.

16. Surena] A Parthian title for the highest minister of
