uses it here in this sense, unless he had really intended to
perplex his readers. Orelli therefore gives the word its proper
technical signification, which Niebuhr1 had explained in his
‘⁶ History of Rome.⁷' ‘⁴ Versum ⁷⁷ is properly ‘⁶ changing one's
creditor,'' or “ borrowing money to pay off an old debt.''
Thence it passed into meaning what we call “ compound
interest.'' We have already seen that Caesar had forbidden
any arrears of interest to be calculated in estimating a debtor's
obligation. Similar laws had been passed before his time, and
the law of Genucius may really have been one of them. Livy
perhaps used the expression “ fenerari '³ loosely, or may have²
simply taken it from Annalists who did not clearly understand
the matter. The tribune’s law may have been only an antici-
pation of Caesar’s legislation‚ and not a sweeping prohibition of
usury altogether. There is a possibility that Tacitus, in these
few words, may have meant to correct what he regarded as a
popular misapprehension of the subject.
