appellabant). With the debtor, too, such payment was a
point of honour. It could, however, be aecomplished only
by a multitude of forced sales. Thus an immense number of
estates were suddenly thrown on the market, and the value of
lauded property was greatly depreciated. The money-lenders
who had boarded up their capital with this view, purchased at
an unfair advantage, while the unfortunate mortgager, the
deeper his obligation, suffered all the greater loss, as he had
to sell under the most msavourable circumstances ‘⁴ Aeyrius
distrahebant‚’‘ says Tacitus of the debtors; that is, they were all
the more grieved at having to sell their proper-tim, ‘⁴ distrahere ''
being a technieal word 111 this sense. and meaning ‘⁶ to sell in
lots.’' The emperor met the crisis by allowing loans from the
treasury 011 which 110 interest was to be paid for three yeme,
these loans being secured on lauded property worth double the
amount.

The law of the dictator Caesar, whieh, Tacitus says, the
money-lenders had transgressed 111 their dealings, was a law
regulating1 the terms of lending and of holding property in
Italy. By “lex ’² he probably means Caesar's general legisla-
tion with respect to the relations of creditors and debtors
rather than any specific enactment. As the leader of the
popular party, Caesar had to provide -for the relies of the
debtor. It was an urgent crisis. A vast amount of the
capital of the country was locked up in the hands of the
money-lenders. Many of Caesar's party clamoured for what
the Romans called “novae tabulae‚” that is, an entire can-
celling of all existing debts. This demand he effectually
resisted. However, in 110, 49, 110 let a ‘law be passed which
prohibited anyone from having more than ssm-JOO sesterces,
or about ι16500, 111 actual cash. Money beyond that amount
was to be invested 111 land. This law was soon dropped.
But debtors were relieved by another² law, which reduced
the amount of each debt by a. deduction from it of all
arr-ears of interest, as well as of all interest already paid. It
was further provided that the creditor's claims were to be
satisficd by his taking the debtor's property according to its
value before the civil war. In this way, ton, he would be a
loser, as all property in land must have been temporarily
depreciated after that period. The deduction of the interest
from the capital, according to Suetonius, had the effect of
reducing the debt, as it then stood, by 25 per cent. This was
a substantial relies to the debtor. Caesar did not stop here.
He endeavoured to devise a method of checking for the future
the accumulation of capital 111 the hands of the money-lenders.
How he did this has been pointed out by Mommsen in his
