NOTES. 6 3

¹3· Detulerat] ‘Had made it the subject of an insor-
mation.' It appears that the title of the play in question was
Atreus, and that a line from Euripides occurred in it, to the
effect that we must bear with the follies of rulers It is in the
Phoenissae, 396: τὰς τῶν κρατούντων ἀμαθίας φέρειν χρεών.

14. Magorum sacra] ‘Magical rites' learnt from the
‘magi‚' the fortune-tellers of the period. Scaurus, it was said,
had consulted them, with an eye, no doubt, to politieal revolu-
tion and the emperor's death. This was a capital offence.
The ‘magus ’ was a particularly conspicuous figure in all great
cities 111 this age. Such a charge against a man might well
follow, as 111 this case, 011 an intrigue with an imperial lady.

15- Ut dignum veteribus Aemiliis] 'A familffias we
are reminded at the end of 011. 27, ‘aboundnig m good eitlzenS.

OHAPTER XXX.

1. Ac tamen] That is, though accusers were so plentiful,
still they got regularly punished on every opportunity, as
happened to the accusers of Scaurus.

2. Omittendae delationis] ‘Dropping a prosecution‚’
which they had undertaken. This sort os collusion with the
other side was called ‘ praevaricatio.’

3. Lentulus Gaetulicus] He had been consul, ΑΛ). 26
(Ν. 46); the younger Pliny mentions him (Epp. v. 3) in a long
list of highly respectable men as a writer of playfuL possibly
rather improper, verses (versiculi parum severi). He was too
a historian, as appears from Suetonius (Calig. 8). He was one
of Caligula’s victims,

1 4ἐἸ Facessit] Said of a man who sets himself to his work
iear 1 y.

5- IS.] Gaetulicus,

6. Ultro damnatur] That is, the ‘delator‘ was caught
in his own trap; the tables were turned on him. So far from
getting Gaetulicus ruined, he got himself ruined. There could
not be a better instance of the force of ‘ultro,’ a word to which
in this sense Tacitus is decidedly partial.

7. Proximo exercitui] The army of Lower Germany
under Lucius Aponius iv. 73.

8. Fama. constans] A well-founded rumour, and one
widely believed.

9· Adfinitatem sibi cum sejano] He had, as said
above, intended to marry his son to Sejanus's daughter.
