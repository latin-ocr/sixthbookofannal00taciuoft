CHAPTER XL.

1. Eo anno] ³⁶ ³⁶ ³⁶ It may be presumed that here came
a list of judicial murders.

2. Neque...advertebatur,] Sc. no notice was taken of
the more ordinary sentences of death. Such things passed

Withohlt remark, from people's familiarity (adsuetudine) with
suc ori-ors.

3· Festinatis lictorum manibus-l The hurried arrest
by lictors was to secure the confiscation of the man's property.

See ch. 29, where we are told that many committed suicide to
avoid this further calamity. The farce of breaking the dead

10. Exsecuti sunt] Sc. they followed up this ‘signum
mortis’ by suicide.

11. Druso] The son of Germanicus, whose horrible
death is related in ch. 2 3.

12. IntestabfflsJ The word implies the last degree of
depravity. Strictly, it means a person disqualified by miscon-
duct for performing any legal act. ‘Detestabilis’ is said of a
person or thing that one would pray against, and is equally
strong.
