CHAPTER XXIX.

1. Prompffls] That is, suffered with decision and
promptitudo.

α. Carnificis] ‘The hangman‚’ as we should say, only
the Roman officer beheaded.

3. Et quia] ‘ The fact that...'
4. De se statuebant] ‘Decided their own fate.v
5- Manebanil] ‘ Remained valia)

6. Pretium festinandi] ‘A reward for prompt action.’
In apposition with the preceding.

Z. {d se repetivisse] ‘He (Tiberius) had revived this

of Piso’s suicide, ‘ suam iuvidiam tali morte quaesitam)

10. Periculi...expertem‚] Labeo's wife, Tiberius says,
had nothing to fem· from me, guilty though she was.

11. Vita probrosus] So much so ‘that Tacitus says of
