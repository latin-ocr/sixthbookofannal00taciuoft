CHAPTER V.

1. Arguitur pleraque] A Greek rather than aLatin eon-
struetion. Pleraque is explained by the infinitives dimissa,
addidisse, the construction of whieh depends on arquitur

‘He is aeeused of many things, dle„ of having said, dfe„ of
having added, &cst 'rhe construction is an unusual one,
though such a construction ns ‘arguit nie hoc feeisse‘ is not
uneonimon.

2. Novendialem cenam] ‘A funeral feast) This
was au old charge, as Livia had died three years before

(xm. ²9)· The point probably was an allusion to her great
:ege and feeble health, or a suggestion that her political
inflnenee (potentia) was dead and buried, or it may have been
a hint that in her ease a funeral feast would be just ns
weleome ns u birthday banquet.
