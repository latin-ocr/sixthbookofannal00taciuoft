NOTES. 47

3. Ius redderet] ‘ To eive judieial decision‚’ so respon-
dere ius, ⁶ 1ο give judicia] opinions'

engi-e §ubitis mederetur] ‘Take aetion 111 sudden emer-
ἓ S.

5. Lucretium] So Livy 1. 59, ‘Brutus imperium in
pglbigqgiigcretm, praefecto urbis iam ante ab rege instituto,

6. Durat simulacrum, &cd ‘The shadow [of the old
custom] still su1·V1ves,’ as when the consuls had to leave Rome

to take part in the feriae Latinae (the festival of the old Latin
Confederation celebrated 111 honour of Jupiter Latiaris on the
Alban mount) apraefeetus was appointed to take their place.

7. Bellis civilibus] ‘In the days of 1110 civil wars,’
i. e. between the death of Caesar and the battle of Actium,
from which event Tacitus dates the Empire.

8. Cilnium Maecenatem] The question of the position
which Maecenas occupied is too long 10 be discussed here.

There is a full account of it in Smith's Dictionary of Bicyraphy,
under the title ‘ Maecenas! He never had the title of Prae-
¹sectus urbis, though he exercised a much larger power 'm the
days of his favour.

9. Messalla, Corvinus] This was the distinguished
soldier and man of letters whom Tibullus addresses in his

first elegy: ‘Te, Messalla, decet terra bellare ma1·ique,’ and
ἓ15οὲτα11011ω611111ἱ1 οιῘΟΨΙέᾟᾙ Horace speaks repeatedly (Ocl. 111. 21.

10. Nescius exercendi] This may have been his pre-
text for resigning it. Thus we harmonize Tacitus' account

with that given in Jerome³s Clu-oniae, that Messalla resigned
the post, deem'mg it incivilem potestatem.

11. Statilius Taurus] A general of some distinction,
who, among other services, commanded the land forces of

Augustus at the battle of Actium. He was Consul suffectus
111 r, c. 39.

12. Viginti per annos] It is impossible to reconcile
this m'th the accounts given by Seneca and Suetonius, These
again differ from each other. Seneca declares that Tiberius
appointed Piso to 11115 office, ΑΛ). 26, when he finally left
Rome for his retreat at Capreae. This would give a period of
six years. Suetonius assigns the appointment to a time about
ten years earlier.
