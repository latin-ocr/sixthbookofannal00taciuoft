THE FINANCIAL CRISIS AT ROME IN A.D. 33.

Tnsssn two chapters require some detailed explanation, both his-
torically and as to certain expressions whioh occur in them.
The finaneial crisis and the ruin in which it involved many
families, are represented by Tacitus as due to a sudden and
wholesale prosecution of the money-lenders, who had been
carrying on their business in a way forbidden by Julius Caesar’s
legislation on this matter. The legal proeeedings arising out
of the affair were on too great a scale to be dealt with in the
usual manner by the praetor, and he therefore referred them to
the Senate. Nearly all the senators appear to have been
implicated in these transactions, and so they begged the
emperor to settle the business as gently and leniently as he
could. The usury-laws of the dictator could not be revived in
a moment. Ayear and a half was granted, within which their
require-ments were to be enforced. During this period all
menies lent on mortgage were called in; this led to a number
of forced sales, under the direction of the treasury officials,
and a large proportion of the speeie found its way into the
exchequer, where it remained locked up. Caesar’s law was
now applied, and the Senate ordered that, in each ease, the
creditor should have lauded security in Italy for only two-
thirds of the amount he had advanced. This was intended
to relieve the debtor and bring back money into circulation.
The creditor who had been exacting high interest would have,
under this arrangement, to submit to a loss of one-third of
his invested capital. Suetonius saysl that the Senate's order
was to the following effect: that the money-lenders were to
invest two-thirds of their property in land, and the debtors
were to pay off at once two-thirds of their debt. However,
it seems clear that the debtor was to be relieved altogether of
one-third of his debt. and this it was which the whole body of
creditor-s resisted. They claimed payment in full (insolidum
