74 TACJTI ANNALIUM LIBER VI.

4· Diem haud concelebraverant] ‘Had not assembled
in state on the day fixed for the coronation.’

5- Alimenta arcu expediens] ‘Proyiding food with
his bow.’ Bitter notes that the word ‘expedire’ denotes ease

and faeility, and con sequently iniplies that the Hyrcanian forests
were well stocked with game.

6. Ubi...venisse‚] ‘As soon as an assurance had been
given that they had come to restore him to power.'

7. Neque...m011itia,] ‘ Saying that the power was not
really in the hands of an Arsacid, bnt that the mere empty

name (of Arsacid) rested with one who from foreign luxury was
without warlike spirit.’ Of course the allusion in ‘foreign
luxury’ is to the fact that Tiridates had been brought up at

Rome. ‘Externa mollitia’ is an ablative of cause dependent
on ‘imbellem.

CHAPTER XLIV.

1. Sensit] Sc. Artabanus·

2. Vetus regnandi] So in ch. η, ‘ scientiae caerimonia-
rum vetus! Tacitus is rather fond of this use of ‘vetus’ We
might render it ⁴ an old hand at kingeraft.'

3. Falsos...fingere,] ‘ He knew that there is less hypo-
crisy about hatred than about loves It is not necessary to

suppose, as Ritter does, that Artabanus was thinking about love
for himself as contr-astet] with hatred of Tiridates. The senti-
ment is a perfectly general one.

4. paedorem] He was found ‘illuvie obsitus! See pre·
ceding chapter.

5· ne anim0.--coaluisse.] ‘Were not even in heart
sufficiently united for loyal obedience.' Had their outward

circumstances been more favourable, it could hardly as yet be
expected that there could be unity of heart and purpose.

supgbrtssllgqm rursum foveant] ‘Whom now again they are

7. Amne objecto] The Tigris on the left or eastern
bank of which Ctesiphon was situated, where Tiridates now
was. See ch. 42· By going back into Mesopotamia Abdageses
would put himself on the right bank of the river.

8. In Syriam revectus] Tiridates by returning int-o
Syria, which was a Roman province, in fact deserted his partl-

sanS, and so absolved them from the disgrace of treachery
towards himself.
