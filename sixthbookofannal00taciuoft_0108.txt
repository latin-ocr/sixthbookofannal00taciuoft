even an historian such as Tacitus, who could not fail to appre-
ciate real greatness and capacity, and would never 310ορ to
the level 01 a Suetonius, might incline in this direction.

That Tacitus has done this, we think there is evidence in
his own pages. We are not prepared to say that his view 01
Tiberius is an utterly inconsistent and impossible one, but it
certainly often seems needlessly harsh, and not quite recon-
cilable with passages in which he recognises the presence 01
good qualities and praiscworthy motiveS, though hc does this
rather grudgingly and reluctantly. He admits himself that
the history of Tiberina, like the histories of Caligula, Claudius,
and Nero, “was falsified, while he reigned, through terror, and
written after his death with the irritation of a recent hatred.’'
This is confessing that 119 drew his accounts from poisoned
sources. He says, indeed, that he has no motives to bitter-
ness or partiality, but his history, at all events its general
tone, produces the impression that, though he could heartily
admire a great man, he was apt to be both bitter and 9011-
temptuous 111 1113 judgments. Towards Tiberius he is almost
always bitter. It waS‚ he gives us to understand, the merest
affectation 01 humility when he professed himself unequal to
the burden 01 empire. The Senate were made to go through a
degradiug farce, that they might sink to a lower depth of adula-
tion. He is representedl as taking offonce at leading senators
from the most unworthy motives. 11 119 911991132 fiattery to his

that several distinguished men, Piso among them, “were de-
stroyed by various charges through his contrivauee.” It is
liinted, not indeed asserted, that ho was responsible for the
death of Germanicus, and that he possibly got rid 01 Ρ130, 1113
instrument 111 accomplishing that death, by foul means. Yet
Niebuhr, who takes an uufavourable view of him, acquits him
of the first crime, and Dean Merivale eonfidently maintains
that he was guilty of neither. It is⁴ rather insinuated that he
allowed thc provinces to be under the same governors for an.
unusually long tinio from bad, or at least improper motives,
though there is reason for believing that the arrangement was
favourable to the iuterests 01 the provincials. In the account
of the prosecution 01 Libo Drusus, when, according to the his-
torian, the system of delation first began to develope itself, the
emperor-‘² is represented as resortiug to an ingenious legal device
iu order to procure his condemnation. NVhen Hortalus applies
to him for help in his poverty, the answer ho received wasss, it
is hinted, gratuitously ungraoious, although it is obvious that
there may have been good reasons for tho emperor-'s sternness,
