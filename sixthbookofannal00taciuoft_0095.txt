NOTES. 75

CHAPTER XLV.

1. Domuum et insularum] The ‘domus’ were the
great houses of the nobility and the very rich; the ‘insulae’

were blocks of buildings let out in chambers and flats. In
these the great bulk of the population of Rome was housed.

2. Contemptu ambitionis] ‘Ambitio’here means‘tem-
porary popularity.’ More permanent fame Tiberius did not

despise, as we see from ch. 46.

3, Haud dedicavit] This was done by his successor
Caligula. Suetonius speaks of these works as ‘imperfectas as

not having been dedicated, (Tiber. 47 3 Calig. 21).

4- Aestimando cuiusque detrimento] ‘To assess the
damages 111 each case.’

5. Quam...rettuli,] See ch. ρο. ‘Ei’ is Caius Caesar: ‘imi-
tando amore ‘ ‘by feignmg love.’

6. Paeto matrimonii vincire] ‘To entangle him in a
matrimonial engagement.'

7. Apisceretur,] Rather an old-fashioned word, which,
as equivalent to ‘poti1·i,’ governs a genitive. The compound,
‘adipisei‚' is common enough, and 111 111. 55, Tacitus construes
it with a genitive (rerum adeptus est).

8. Commotus ingenio] Se. he was liable to such
paroxysms of rage as to suggest insanity. Of Agrippina (1. 33)
it is said that she was ‘paullo commotior‚' that is, ‘rather too
hot-tempered.’ Tacitus seems to have regarded Caligula as
almost a madman, as he speaks of him (Hist. 1v. 48) as ‘turbi-

dus animi.’

h 9. ‘Simulationum salsa] ‘The deeeits of every sort of
ypocrlsy.

10. Avi] Of course Caius Caesar was merely by adoption

the {randlson of Tiberius. The emperor was however really his
grea -une e.

CHAPTER XLVI.

1. Hoc] This seems to refer to the plans of Macro with
regard to Caius Caesar as well as to the immediately preceding
sentence. All was known to the emperor, both these plans and

the young man's character.

2. Nepotes] The son of Drusus (his name was Tiberius,)
the emperor’s own grandson, and Gaius, the son of Germanicus.
