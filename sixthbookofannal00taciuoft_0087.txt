No TES. 67

3. Feruntque ...... re etivit] Their origin, they said,
dated from the time when ason, subsequently to his return to
Thessaly after his victorious expedition, went a second time
with his wife Medea, and his children by her, to her native
Colchi, and restored his father-in-law Aeetes to his kingdom,
from which in the meantime he had been expelled. The royal
palace was ‘inanis'3 that is, after Medea’s flight there were no
children to succeed their father in the kingdom, and Colchi
was ‘vacui‚' because its king had been ejected. So in 51

governor is said to be ‘vacua;’ and so also a legion that has
lost its commander (11. 46). The legends about Jason are con-

3. Ictibus] Sc. their missiles, particularly their arrows.
In these they were far superior to the Sarmatae.

4- Quo brevius valent] Se. their bows did not carry so
far as those of the enemy. ‘Brevms' means a shorter range.

5. Frontis et tergi vices] Sc. ‘ alternations of advanee
and retreat;' they now showed their faces, now their backs.

Understand ‘essent’ depending on ‘cum.'

6. Ut conserta, acies] ‘As an army in close confliet‚'
