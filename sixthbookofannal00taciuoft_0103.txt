“History of Rome 1.'’ He prescribed, it seems, the amount
of loans at interest, and fixed the proportion each loan was to
bear to the value of the estate on which it was secured. It
was, perhaps, not to exceed half the value. The object of his
legislation was to make every capitalist a landowner in Italy,
and so to hinder the growth of a class which might be able to
lock up in its coffers all the ready money of the country.
Mommsen thinks that he went farther than this, and pre-
scribed not only the maximum amount of loans, but also
maximum rates of interest. It was this legislation of Caesar
which the usurers, described in this passage 01 the Annals,
had set at nought. It would seem that properties had been
mortgaged for their full, or nearly their full value, that high
rates of interest had been exacted, and that arrears of interest
had been added to the original loan. In many ways, no doubt,
the money-lenders had laid themselves open to prosecution
under the laws of the first Caesar.

There cannot be much question, we think, as to the mean-
ing of the phrase ‘⁶ unciarium fenus.⁷⁷ Itis absurd to suppose,
as some do, that it can mean interest at one per cent. per
annum. This could not have been possible in a community 111
which money was so scarce, as was the case with Rome in her
early days. In such states the rates of interest 310 always what
we should consider high. As Niebuhr long ago pointed out,
‘⁶ unciarium fenus ’³ denotes interest equal to ἧς of the capital,
or 8²3- per cent. This was for a year of ten months, the old
Roman year. On twelve months it would be 10 per cent„
and in this view Mommsen concurs.

It 15 1055 easy to say what Tacitus means by “ versura.'’
Does he mean simply “usu1·y,’' and is he referring to a law
carried by Lucius Genucius, a tribune of the plebs, ac. 341,
which, according to Livywu. 42), forbade usury altogether?
He has just said that the interest was reducedfrom 10 to 5 per
cent. (semunciaeQand Livy.(v11. 27) tells 115 that this was done
B.c. 344. The total prohibition of usury seems to us very
preposterous, and possibly Livy may have misunderstood what
Genucius attempted. Still, we can conceive that a tribune in a
time of popular excitement may have really carried such a law.
To this view Niebuhr inclined, and, though Orelli thinks it
quite untenable‚ Mommsen2 appears to adopt it. “ The tak-
ing 01 usury‚’‘ he says, “ was at length altogether hirbiddenss’
We observe that Ritter, too, in his note on this passage (in 1115
last edition) takes “versura ” as simply equivalent to “fene·
ratio,’' and quotes Livy, vn. 42, in support of 1115 opinion.
This interpretation has generally found favour with the trans-
lators of Tacitus. It is possible that “ versura '’ may have
this meaning, but it is rather strange to suppose that Tacitus
