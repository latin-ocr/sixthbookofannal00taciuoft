NOTES. 77

Drusus, the emperor's brother; so we must suppose that she
had her information from Secundus.

4. 1npietatis] A vague charge, which would imply high
treason under circumstances of peculiar aggravation. Adultery
with certain persons might be high treason, and this perhaps
applied to Albucilla. The offence would then be described as
‘impietas’ It would also be ‘impietas’ to consult astrologers
about the emperor's life and the prospects of empire.

t· 5. connectebantur] ‘Were included in the prosecu-
ion.³

6. De claritudine...memoravi.] See note on ch· 1.

7. Praesedisse] That is, Macro conducted the inquiry
just as he pleased, cross-examining witnesses and putting
slaves to the torture without having the senate’s authority.
This was an extreme measure. and quite contrary to Tiberius’s
usual method of proceeding. He generally observed legal forms.

8. Commentarfi] These gave an account of the inquiry
with the answers of witnesses. They would be something like
our judges' notes, if Macro could be described as a judge.

9. Nullaeque...litterae,] The absence of any letter from
the emperor against them, that is, the persons prosecuted along

with Albucilla. This naturally suggested that Macro was at
the bottom of the whole affair.

tc?- Invalido ac fortasse ignaro] ‘While the emperor
was 1ll and perhaps knew nothing about it.’ The sentence
must be taken as an ablative absolute.

CHAPTER XLVIII.

1· MeditanS] ‘Preparingss

2. Ludibria] Insulting treatment from Tiberius who, we
are told (1. 13), disliked Arruntius as a clangerous man because
of his wealth and ability‚ and high reputation.

3- Quemadmodum...iuventam.] ‘How was he to get
safely through the youth of the emperor With whom they were

threatened?' ‘Imminentis' suggests the idea of something
hanging over one’s head and just about to fall. The word is
very appropriate to Caius Caesar, whose known savage temper
would soon be let loose.

4. ConvulsuS.] sc. thoroughly perverted and corrupted.
The word is a very strong one, and denotes a complete revo-
lution in a man’s character, such as could be due only to the
shock of some great change of circumstances·
