ΤΗ Ε E M PEROR TIBERIUS. 89

and equally certain, as Tacitus takes care to tell us, that he
could be and often was extremely munificent. Sejanus was
probably a bad man, elever and able, but of a low and vulgar
type, and his elevation is perhaps a serious blot on Tiberius,
but the emperor waS, it must be remembered, aged and lonely.
The result, no doubt, was frightfully disastrous to Rome, and
it would be useless to deny that the thickest gloom hung over
his last years. They were, in fact, a reign of terror. Was
Tiberius to be pitied or simply detested ⁴? His famous letter to
the Senate in which he says1 that ‘⁶ he does not know what to
write, or how to write, or what not to write,” is susceptible of
two meanings. Tacitus chooses the worst, and assumes it to
have been the expression of remorse. YVhen he finally sums
up his character, it is² in a bitter sentence in which he plainly
hints that his temper had always been radically viciouS.

On the whole, we think that there cannot be much doubt
that Tacitus inclines to an unfairly severe view of this emperor.
He had nierits, as he admits, judicious munificence, administra-
tive ability, thoughtfulness for the rights and welfare of the
provincials. He was a good and careful financier, and would
not let public money be squandered in the vulgar show of gladia-
toria] exhibitions. He was frugal and economical in his personal
habits, and the imperial establishment³ was not so great or
splendid as some of those of the nobles. He would receive4
legacies only from friends, thoughit was the fashion of the time
for rich men to remember the emperor in their wills. It is clear
from Tacitus's own account that he had many of the qualities
which go to make a wise and just ruler. Equally clear is it from
the same account that the malignant gossip of the day often
charged him with the foulest crimes without theleast real ground,
as in the case of the death of Drusus. The historian's marked
bitterness is no doubt to be explained by the fact that he re-
garded Tiberius as the deliberate organiser of the hateful prac-
tice οἱ “ delation‚⁷' and as thus the murderer of his country’s
liberties. This is the view which is ever present to his mind,
and it leads him to be continually attributing bad motives and
suspecting apparently good ones. The hideous horrors con-
nected with “delation,'’ which were still fresh in his memory,
hardly allowed him to do justice to the emperor in whose reign
they began to show themselves. Tiberius indeed, he is caresul
to tell us, often inclined to mercy, mitigated a harsh sentence
of the Senate, or even stopped a prosecution altogether, and
the actual number of persons who perished on charges of treason
previous to the ascendency of Sejanus was, as Professor Beesly
has pointed out, comparatively small. Yet even in these cases,
we often meet with an ill-natured remark or insinuation, which
betrays the animus of the writer. It is possible that we might
have had a different picture of the emperor, had his reign closed
