before the rise of Sejanus. As it is, there can hardly be a
question that its last years, when he buried himself in the
seclusion of Capreae, were exceptionally horrible, and of this,
as Dean Merivale remarks 1, we have an evidence in the paralysis
and almost utter extinction of all literature.

The truth about Tiberius seems to be that he had many
moral and intellectual qualities of a high order, but was hard
and unsympa-thetic. He was not the man to be popular while
he lived, or to be remembered for his virtues after his death.
Very possibly, he had much of the cynical temper which is
often allied to a commanding intellect. Perhaps, as has
been conjectured, he may really have had a touch of the here-
ditary insanity which is said to have been characteristic of the
Claudian house. If so, the stol-ies about his abominable old
age at Capreae may have an element of truth in them. But
even though Tacitus seems to have believed them, we must
bear in mind that they must have rested wholly on mere gossip,
and that all gossip is particularly apt to be unfavourable to
a man who is never seen in publie‘u‘. It may be that the
memoirs of the younger Agrippina, to which Tacitus once refers,
were the main source from which these stories were drawn.
Whether the old emperor, in disgust at the state of Rome and
the prospects of the empire, may have taken refuge in utter
sensuahty, is a question we have no means of answering. With
the evidence before us, we are not, we think, justified in pro-
nouncing a confident opinion. It is to be further noted that,
like many men of powersul intellect, he appears to have had a
vein of superstition, and to have valued and believed in astro-
logy³. He was possibly a fatalisn and this may be a clue to
some of the obscure passages of his life. With all the extant
accounts we have of him, it still seems that, as Dean Merivale
says 4, we have “to scau the features of this ill—omened princi-
pate through a treacherous and distorting haze.'’
