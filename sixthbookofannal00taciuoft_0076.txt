in the senate that the year should be dated, not, as was usual,
by the names of the consuls for the particular year. but by

those of the holders os the ‘tribunitia potestas.¹ This was
always the emperor.

4. Subdola modestia] ‘A cunningly assumed sels-re-
pression,' ‘modestia’ implying submissiveness to the em-
peror's wishes.

5. Rupta, voce] Like ῥῆξαι φωνήν, of a sudden abrupt

6. Qualem diem ...... verbis] Tiberius’s daily demeanour
was exactly imitated by his grandson, and almost his very

having become Agrippina’s husband. Quintilian (η. 10, ιι)
speaks of his ‘jucunditas‚’ by which we suppose he meant his
pleasant wit. It seems that he was lucky enough to live to
the reign of Claudius and then die a natural death.

9. Praesagium Tiberii] According to Suetonius it was
Augustus who said this to Galba when a mere child3 καὶ σύ,

τέκνον, τῆς ἀρχῆς ἡμῶν παρατρώξῃ. Josephus however, agrees
with Tacitus. ‘Degustabis’ you shall have a taste of.

10. Per-temptatum] ‘ Thoroughly sounded.’

thu. Quandoque] For ‘quandocunque‚’ ‘some day or
o er!

CHAPTER XXI.
