48 TACJTI ANNALIUM LIBER VJ.

CHAPTER XII.

1. Quindecimvirum] ‘ One of the Fifteen.' The
‘Fifteen (in earlier days the number was ‘Ten ⁵) had the
charge of the Sibylline books, which it was not lawful to con-
sult except when the Senate, on the occurrence of some diffi-
culty, authorized the consultationi. These bore the title of
Quindecemviri Sibyllini or Quindcccmviri sacris faciundis.

τ. Per discessionem facto] ‘Carried b) dividing the
House.’ It is difficult to express the meaning 1n a singl(¹

phrase, but Tacitus means to irnply that it was not thought
necessary to take the votes soparatffly, the matter not bein?y
one of great importance. The ⁴ Aycs' and ‘Noes’ went to oppo-
site sides of the chamber. On questions of higher importuuce
the votes were taken in order (per sententias exquisitas).

3. Vetus] Ahnost equivalent to ἀίιι peritus. The con-
struction is post-Augustan. A similar phrase occurs again in
the beginning of c, 44, ‘vetus regnandi.’

4. Incerto auctore] ιΤ110111111 the authority [of the
book] was doubtfuL’ ‘she auctor was the person who vouched

sor its being genuine.

5, Magistros] Every sacred college had its maqister or
dean, who was supposed to be well acquainted with its peculiar
lore, and capable ot' dcciding any disputed point. We find in
the decree of the Senate regulating the Bacchanalian worship
(passed Β. C. 186) that associations of these worshippers were
forbidden to have a magister, as this would imply that the)-
were constituted into a college, just as they were forbidden for
the same reason to have pecnnia communis (magister neve vir
neque mulier quisquam esset. Neve pecuniam quisquam
eorum communem habuisse velit). What the meaning οἱ 111(-
plural may be is unam-mim possibly those who had exercised
this officc; ‘ past-masters)

6- Infrequentem senatum] We may comparo a
passage 111 the Senatu< Cous-ultum, quote} above, forbiddiug

that a motion relating to the Bacchanalian worship should 111·
brought before 1110 Senatu when there were less than a hundred
membcrs present.

7. Sanxisse Augustt1n2...lice1fet,] Augustus had pro-
claimed a day before wlnch, dc. Suetonius thus describes¹
this proceeding on the part of Augustus. ‘Quidquid fatidi-
corum librorum Graeci Latinique generis nullis vel parum
idoneis auctoribus vulgo ferebatur. Supra duo millia contracta
undiquc cremavit, et solos retinuit Sibyllinos<3 hos quoquc,
