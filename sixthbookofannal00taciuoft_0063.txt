notice, and proceeds to prove his statement by a narrative
which he rel-ates.

2. Ob id.] i.e. amicitiam.

3· Amplecti] ‘ To avow it.’

4. Patris] This was Seius Strabo, who is mentioned as
having been commander of the Praetorians at the death of
Augustus (1. 3). Sejanus was associated with him in this
command in the first year of the reign of Tiberius ( 1. 24).

5· validus ad amicitiam] ‘ Strong enough to secure.'

6. Sordibus] ‘ humiliation ' with a probable allusion to
the sordidata vestis, which was customarily worn by persons
under accusation.

7. Exemplo] ‘Nor do Ι pitch upon any one whose ex-
ample I followed: i. e. ‘1 arn not secking a precedent.’

8. Novissimi consilii] ‘ His last design‚’ the discovery
of which was made, it was said, by a letter addressed to
Tiberius by Antonia, widow of his brother Drusus, and mother
of Germanicus and Claudius

9. Vulsiniensem] ‘ The mere townsman of Vulsinii.⁷
Vulsinii was an Etrurian town. So Juvenal, Sat. x. 74 and 75,
‘ Si favisset Nursia Tusco)

10- Quas adfinitate occupaverat] ‘111 which he had
usurped a place by marriage alliances.’ His daughter Julia
had been betrothed to a son ot‘ Claudius, but the lad was
accidentally killed (choked, Suetonius says, bya pear which he
was tossing up and catching 111 h-is mouth) a few days after the
betrothal. Occuparerat gives the idea of sudden and forcible
action.

11. Generum] This should strictly be proqenerum,
‘husband of your granddaughter.’ This granddaughter was
not actually married to Sejanus. Suetonius (Tiber. 65) says
that he was ‘spe adfinitatis deceptum.' Julia was the widow
of Nero, eldest son of Germanicus and Agrippina, and one of
Sejanus’ victims. She afterwards married Rubellius Blan-
dus, and was put to death by Claudius at the instigation of
Messalina.

12. Consulatus] Sejanus had been consul in the very
year of his death.

133- Quae coram habentur] ‘What is put before our
eyes.

14· Neo ideo adsequare] ‘Nor will you therefore
(i. e. because you have ventured to try) succeed (in discovering
them) ;’ adsequare is potential.
