52 TACJTI ANNALIUM LIBER VI.

4. omissam olim] ‘Long since become obsolete.’

5. Vetus urbi] Livy’s early books abound with re-
ferences to this matter. See Livy 11. 23, 24.

6. Cohibebatur] Sc. restrained by legal enactments.

7. Primo] The law of the Twelve Tables in 13.C. 450,
11115, it may be inferred from Livy vn. 16, re-enacted in 554, on
the motion of two ‘tribuni plebis!

8. Unciario fenore] Ten per cent. per annum, ‘ uncia ’
being fifth of the ⁴3.ss from the fractione of which Roman
interest was calculated. A borrower paid ffith of the sum
borrowed for 10 months, the old Roman year. This would
be at the rate of 10 per cent. for the year of 12 months. It is
impossible to accept the view of some editors that it was
merely 1 per cent. per annum.

9. Exerceret] Understand ‘rem’ or ‘ negotium.'

¹0- Rogatione tribunicia] In 344 uc. See Livy vn.
7. The eflect of this according to the view we reject would

have been to reduce the rate of interest to one-halt⁴ per cent.
This strikes us as the height of absurdity.

11· Postremo vetita versura] See Livy vn. 42, who
11181111οΠ5, but evidently without believing it, that lending on
interest was altogether forbidden. Tacitus's version of the
matter is that versura, compoztnd interest, as we call it, was
forbidden. It is hardly to be supposed that by ‘versura he
means exactly the same as ordinary fenus. The necessity for
such an enactment as Livy records suggests at least that the
interest hitherto paid must have been much higher than 0118
per cent. per annum.

12. Fraudibus] ‘Evasions oi the law!

R 13. lQuaestio] ‘The inquiry3’ a technical phrase of
oman axv.

¹4· Concedente] Sc. the emperor.
15. Legis] Se. the ‘Ie‘x Dictatoris Caesaris)
16. Rationes familiares] ‘ His own private accounts)

CHAPTER XVII.
