SIXTH· BOOK OF THE ANNALS
OF TAOITUS.

INTRODUOTION.

ΤΗΕ Sixth Book of the Annals of Tacitus embraces
a period of five years, from A.D. 32 to 37. They
are the closing years of the reign of the third of
the Caesars, Tiberius Claudius Nero.

Almosb all the Fifth Book is unfortunately lost.
In this was related the fall of Sejanus, the prosecu-
tions arising out of which rendered this period a reign
of tertor. With inhese the Sixnh Book opens. Tiberius
encouraged them, and Tacitus implies thafi he did so
with a peeuliarly savage vindictiveness. Of all the
blots on the emperor's memory‚ many οἱ which may
well be due to perverse and wilsul misrepresentatspn,
these are unquestionably the blackesb and most
hideous.
