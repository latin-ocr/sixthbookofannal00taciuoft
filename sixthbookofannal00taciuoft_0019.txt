titles of honour. Sejanus, who knew him well, must
have seen that the end was near, and thought that
he might as well attempt a conspiracy against his
life. It was disclosed by one of the conspirators,
Satrius Secundus, to Antonia, the mother of Ger-
manicus and the emperor's sister-in-law. At last the
dangerous man was at his patron's mercy. Then
came what Juvenal calls the “verbosa et grandis
epistola¹ '' from Capri, which for a time mystified the
Senate, till on finding that certain of Sejanus’s well-
known friends and adherents were pointed at for
punishment, they soon divined its purport. Sudden
and awful‚ and we may say deserved, was the destruc-
tion of the man to whom Tiberius mainly owes the
infamy which has clung to his name. Strangled in

the Mamertine dungeon and dragged to those Ge-
monian stairs, leading to the Tiber, with which the

readers of Tacitus are painfully familiar, his statues
flung down and shivered to atoms, the great minister
of state was followed up in his death by a furious
mob, hooting him as “Caesel-’s enemy.'’ There was
immense popular emitement, and the prosecution and
ruin of a host of 1115 friends was a matter of course.
It 15 a horrible story, and one shudders at the pas-
sage² in Tacitus, truly fearful in its directness of
speech, which relates how his little girl, “ignorant
of her crime and saying she would never do so again‚''
was hurried off to execution.
