86 TACITI ANNALIUM LIBER VI.

ment. All take the unfavourable view. Suetonius, however,
is a writer not to be highly valued. He was fond of gossip and
scandaL and he had not much discrimination in choosing his
materials. He goes out of his way to fill his pages with
disgusting details of the emperor's alleged profligacy. Very
possibly, too, being a contemporary ot Tacitus, he may have
been brought almost entirely under his historical influence,
and 1101 have ventured to exercise an independent judgment.
Dion Cassius wrote his history nearly two centuries after the
death of Tiberius, and so had to depend wholly on previous
111-110151. Ηο seems not to have been a remarkably acute
man, and a character like that cf Tiberius was one with which
he was hardly competent to deal. He describes it as a com-
pound of many virtues and many vices, both of which were
carried to extreme lengths. Substantially, he does not differ
from Tacitus, who indeed, we may fairly assume, formed the
views of subsequent authors in all their main outlines. Next
comcs Velleius Paterculus. He was a soldier, and had served
under Tiberius in Germany and in Pannonia in the years
A.D. 5 and 6. Of these campaigns he wrote a narrative
during Tiberius’s reign. Niebuhr appears to have had a high
opinion of him2‚ though he admits that he had bad features
in his character. “He is,” he says, “trustworthy‚ and an
excellent historical source, where he had no temptation to
distort the truth.⁷' Such a temptation, however, must have
been tolerably strong at the time when 110 was writing. Dean
Merivale3 speaks of him as a courtly panegyrist, and this, we
believe, is the commonly accepted view. Very possibly he was
a good soldier, and he is certainly a elever writer, but the fact
that he persistently praises Sejanus is hardly in his favour.
thatever we may think of Tiberius, there cannot be much
doubt that Sejanus's infiuence over him was for evil. unless,
indeed, there was a deliberate conspiracy among all the chief
later authors to deceive postcrity. We have no right indeed
to disregard the testimony of Velleius, or to question that he
felt a sincere admiration of Tiberius, but still we cannot help
thinking that much of his language is close akin to fiattery.
This, indeed, was not unnaturaL as Tiberius was his patron.
Flattery‚ too, of a very gross kind was unfortunately becoming
more and more characteristic of the age, and this may be
fairly taken as an excuse for Velleius when he speaks of the
cmperor’s ‘² divine deeds ;’' of his ‘⁶ superhuman munificenee3'’
of his “incredible and unspeakable filial piety,’‘ dc, dcc.
We can believe that such rhetorical phrases as these may
have been used without consciens insincerity. Still, they
ought to be noted, when an attempt is made to represent
