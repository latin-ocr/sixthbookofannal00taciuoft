38 TACJTI ANNALIUM LIBER VI.

The account of her death came within one of the lost portions
of the Annals. Dion Cassius says that the Emperor would
have spared her life for her mother Antonia’s sake, αὑτὴ δέ ὴ
Ἀντωνία ἑκοῦσα λιμῷ τήν θυγατέρα ἑξώλεσε.

3. Sententiae] ‘ Proposals in the Senate.'

4. Bona Seiani ...... referret] The aerarium was the
treasury of the State, the fiscus the Emperor's private purse.
Both were so absolutely in the power of the Emperor that

it could not be said to matter if any fund was transferred from
one to the other.

5. Scipiones ὅσα] ‘ Such men as the Scipios, &c.'

6. Per deridiculum] ‘By way of a fasce) Of course
the feeling was not expressed. The absurdity of the proposal

lay in the fact well known to every one that Tiberius would
never again visit Rome.

7. Orabat] ‘ He was for begging.⁷

8. Epistulae] It is not clear whether this is a reference
‘to the letter (the verbosa et yraudfis epistula of Juvenal, x. 71)
in which Tiberius denounced Sejanus to the Senate, or to
another despatched shortly before this occurrence, when the
Emperor was about to make the Journey described in c. 1.
Orelli seems to be right in preferring the latter.

9· Honoribus ...... e magistratibus] ‘Were they to be
men who had held the highest offioes, or aspffants to office;
simple senators or magistrates? '

10. Verbis moderans] ‘restrained in his language.’

11. Abolitionem] The proposal was not to bo merely
gegeigeggtffglras to be erased from the books3 a distinct censure

η. Suadere] The historicalinfinitive.

QHAPTER ΙΙΙ.

ι. Iunium Gallionem] This was not the Gallio of Acts
xviii. 12, but probably his father by adoption.

2. Quatuordecim ordinibus] ‘The fourtecn benches
of the linights) A centurio prinzelpilaris became an eques
when his term of service had expired. Gallio seems to have
proposed the extension of tho privilege to all tium-expired
privates of the force.. These privates were of course of higher
standing than the ordinary logionary.
